# Gilded Rose Kata
This is a possible solution to the [Gilded Rose Kata](https://kata-log.rocks/gilded-rose-kata) for training the application of the SOLID Principles.

## Current solution
The kata is solved without some of the restrictions of its statement. For instance, the restriction of non editing the Item class has been removed because it does not allow to fully apply the OCP.

## Solution with restrictions
You can check the solution with restrictions in the tag `solved-with-restrictions`
